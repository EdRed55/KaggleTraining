    -Add in function to create new columns, clean up Na values for both training and testing data (done)
    -Add in graph showing decision tree using: "http://chrisstrelioff.ws/sandbox/2015/06/08/decision_trees_in_python_with_scikit_learn_and_pandas.html" or "http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html" (done)
    -Add in cross validation to decision tree using (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) (done)
    -Recreate DecisionTreeTitanic in R (done)
    -Type up summary of cross validation
    -What to do after cross validation occurs? Refit model with all data included?
    -Create stand alone files for other methods used in Python_Tutorial_20160603.py
